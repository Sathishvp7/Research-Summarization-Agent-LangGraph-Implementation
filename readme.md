# üîπ Research & Summarization Agent ‚Äî LangGraph Implementation

This project demonstrates how to build an **Agentic AI system** using **LangGraph** that combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **role-based access control (RBAC)**, and **web search fallback** to provide secure, context-rich responses.  

The design extends my earlier RAG-based chatbot implementation into a **graph-based agent workflow**, giving modularity, observability, and memory-driven conversational continuity.

## ‚úÖ Key Features

- **Role-Aware Query Handling**  
  - Queries are classified into categories:  
    - `employee`  
    - `engineer`  
    - `hr`  
    - `finance`  
    - `marketing`  
  - Ensures users only receive responses relevant to their role.

- **Web Search Fallback**  
  - If no relevant internal documents are found in the vectorstore, the query is routed to **web search** for external context.

- **Context & Memory**  
  - Maintains conversational history to handle follow-up questions.  
  - Supports pronoun resolution (e.g., *"Where was he born?"* ‚Üí links back to previously mentioned CEO).

- **Graph-Oriented Workflow**  
  - Uses **LangGraph** to define explicit nodes and transitions:  
    - `categorize_inquiry` ‚Üí role-specific response generators  
    - `search_web` ‚Üí for external queries  
    - All converge into `generate_answer`
